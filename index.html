        <p>When you donate to The Salvation Army, you are giving the gift of hope to countless men, women, and
            children who come through our doors every day looking for a helping hand and a path to a brighter
            future.</p>

                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, the family members of serious patients do not have time to look after themselves, not even
                    have the time to have food, which is the basic necessity as they are always around taking care of
                    their
                    close ones.</p>

                    who’ve been knocked down, and it can happen to you too. Not all of us made bad life choices.</p>

                <h2>Education for child</h2>
                <p>Education is important for everyone, whether we are adults or children. Child education is very much
                    important as they absorb the basics of everything in their childhood. Child education in our society
                    is
                    important as many people do not consider child education as important as they think they can become
                    equal to their elders by education. Or most the people in the society think that after getting an
                    education, their children will leave them because they will consider them as illiterate.</p>
